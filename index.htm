    In the past 40 years, the share of married adults in the U.S. has declined, while the share of young adults living with parents increased. Both of these trends have been driven by the non-college educated. I study the role of house prices in explaining these trends.

      How do property taxes affect house prices, homeownership, and welfare? I focus
on Italy, a country with high homeownership, an outdated property tax system,
and failed reform attempts. As in many other countries, owner-occupied houses
are exempt from property taxes in Italy. Additionally, property taxes are calculated
using outdated cadastral values. I show that using cadastral values creates a
regressive property tax since cadastral values are relatively lower for more expensive
housing units. I develop a life-cycle model with endogenous homeownership
to assess the effects of reforming the current system. My findings show that removing
the owner-occupied exemption and adjusting cadastral values to market
values increases government property tax revenues as a percentage of GDP by over
0.8 percentage points but also increases homeownership rates by 1.2 percentage
points. The increase in homeownership results from lower property tax rates on
smaller houses. Finally, I show that in the short run, the reform increases the
welfare of young households but lowers the welfare of older ones. In the long run,
welfare increases for new generations. Higher welfare is mainly due to the decrease
in house prices in equilibrium.
