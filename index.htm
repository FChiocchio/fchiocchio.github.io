  <p id="abs-lp_panels_1" class="abstract" style="display:none">
    Over the past 40 years in the U.S., marriage rates have declined significantly while parental coresidence among young adults has  increased sharply, especially among the non-college educated. At the same time, rising house prices have outpaced income growth, decreasing housing affordability. This paper analyzes how these rising prices influence coresidence and marriage decisions. I first present a stylized model illustrating the dual impact of higher house prices: they encourage marriage due to economies of scale but also lead to more individuals living with parents, decreasing participation in the marriage market. Then, I develop a quantitative life-cycle model of household formation (marriage and divorce) and housing choices (coresidence, renting, and buying). The model economy is characterized by equilibrium in the marriage and housing markets and is calibrated to the 2019 U.S. economy. I use the model for two exercises. First, I quantify the role of house prices on the marital decline between 1980 and 2019. I find that house prices explain around 50% of the decline in marriage within the model. Furthermore, the model can account for the larger drop in marriage among the non-college educated. Second, I evaluate the effect of housing policies and find that a 10% rental subsidy financed by higher taxes can increase marriage rates among young adults by 5 percentage points, primarily by reducing parental coresidence.

    <h2>Why Not Tax It? The Effects of Property Taxes on House Price and Homeownership</h2>
    <a class="more" onclick="showhide('abs-lp_panels_2')">Abstract</a>&nbsp;
    <a class="paper" href="files/Papers/WhyNotTaxIt.pdf">Working paper</a>&nbsp;
    <p id="abs-lp_panels_2" class="abstract" style="display:none">
      How do property taxes affect house prices, homeownership, and welfare? This
study focuses on Italy, a country with high homeownership, an outdated property
tax system, and unsuccessful reform attempts. In Italy, owner-occupied houses are
exempt from property taxes, and property taxes are based on outdated cadastral
values, which increase the regressivity of the tax system. Specifically, cadastral
values capture a smaller percentage of market value for more expensive properties.
I develop a life-cycle model with endogenous homeownership to evaluate the
effects of reforming the current system. My findings reveal that removing the
owner-occupied exemption and updating cadastral values to reflect market values
increases property tax revenues as a percentage of GDP by over 0.8 percentage
points and raises homeownership rates by 2.6 percentage points. This increase in
homeownership is driven by lower property tax rates on smaller houses. Finally,
I show that this policy improves the welfare of new generations in the long run,
primarily due to a decrease in house prices in equilibrium. However, in the short
run, the welfare of older households decreases.
