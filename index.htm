    Over the past 40 years in the U.S., marriage rates have declined significantly while parental coresidence among young adults has  increased sharply, especially among the non-college educated. At the same time, rising house prices have outpaced income growth, decreasing housing affordability. This paper analyzes how these rising prices influence coresidence and marriage decisions. I first present a stylized model illustrating the dual impact of higher house prices: they encourage marriage due to economies of scale but also lead to more individuals living with parents, decreasing participation in the marriage market. Then, I develop a quantitative life-cycle model of household formation (marriage and divorce) and housing choices (coresidence, renting, and buying). The model economy is calibrated to the 2019 U.S. economy. I use the model for two exercises. First, I quantify the role of house prices on the marital decline between 1980 and 2019. I find that house prices explain around 50% of the decline in marriage within the model. Furthermore, the model can account for the larger drop in marriage among the non-college educated. Second, I evaluate the effect of housing policies and find that a 10% rental subsidy financed by higher taxes can increase marriage rates among young adults by 5 percentage points, primarily by reducing parental coresidence.

    <h2>Why Not Tax It? The Effects of Property Taxes on House Price and Homeownership</h2>
    <a class="more" onclick="showhide('abs-lp_panels_2')">Abstract</a>&nbsp;
    <a class="paper" href="files/Papers/WhyNotTaxIt.pdf">Working paper</a>&nbsp;
    <p id="abs-lp_panels_2" class="abstract" style="display:none">
      Owner-occupied housing units are exempt from property taxes in many countries. How does the owner-occupied exemption affect house prices, home ownership, and welfare? If owner-occupied housing is taxed, should the tax be progressive? To answer these questions, I develop a life-cycle model of homeownership with heterogeneous agents. I calibrate the model to the Italian housing market, where owner-occupied houses are exempt from property taxes, and taxes are based on cadastral values that understate the value of more expensive properties. This discrepancy creates a regressive system, despite a proportional statutory tax rate. The results show that removing only the owner-occupied exemption increases property tax revenues as a percentage of GDP by over 0.8 percentage points but reduces the homeownership rate by 2.6 percentage points. However, complementing this policy with the adjustment of the cadastral values, i.e., switching from a regressive to a proportional property tax based on market values, counteracts the decline in homeownership and generates the same level of property tax revenue. Additionally, the reform improves the welfare of new generations across steady states. However, the average welfare of households alive at the time of the reform decreases, with young households being better off, while older households are losing out. This highlights the political tension surrounding these reforms.

    <h2>Opioids and Post-COVID Labor Force Participation</h2>

    <p id="abs-lp_panels_3" class="abstract" style="display:none">
      At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the labor force participation of the working-age US population dropped by about three percentage points. The recovery was slow, and three years after the start of the pandemic, the labor force participation was still below its pre-pandemic level. The pace of recovery of the labor supply varied widely across US states. To understand this variation, the role of the opioid crisis, which was unfolding in the US before the COVID-19 pandemic, is studied. Labor supply recovery in the aftermath of COVID-19 was slower in states with greater pre-COVID exposure to the opioid crisis, measured by pre-COVID age-adjusted opioid overdose death rates. An event-study analysis shows that a one-standard-deviation increase in pre-COVID age-adjusted death rate is associated with a one percentage point drop in labor force participation after COVID-19. The effect of prior opioid exposure had a more significant impact on individuals without a college degree. The slow recovery in states with more opioid exposure was characterized by an increase in individuals who are not in the labor force due to disability.
